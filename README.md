# ExPoser Previewer
> ExPoser Previewer is only supported on Ren'Py 7 and 8.

ExPoser Previewer is a DDLC pose previewing tool that allows modders to pose and express their characters in real-time within DDLC. 

With support for all Mood Pose Tool (MPT)/ExPoser (ExP) ones, there are endless possibilities to pose in DDLC. With ExPoser Previewer, this tool allows you to view all of them for not just each of the doki's, but including other characters as well!

## Features
- Preview any pose and expression from MPT/ExPoser in real-time.
- Copy pose code from ExPoser Previewer to your mod.
- Change bg scenery.
- Mulitple character posing.
- Dynamic character fetching (characters are auto-defined).

## Installation
> Make sure you have MPT **or** MPT + ExPoser installed in your mod before doing this.
1. Download ExPoser Previewer from [here](https://github.com/GanstaKingofSA/ExPoser-Previewer/releases).
2. Drop the contents from the ZIP file to your mod.
4. Launch DDLC.
5. Press *Shift+F5* and get to posing.

## What difference does this have to the Doki Doki Posing Tool site?
The Posing Tool site from what I know only supports the Doki cast and a few other characters that only supports DDLC syntax. ExPoser Previewer supports MPT/ExPoser syntax with a finite amount of possibilities of pose/express any character which supports MPT/ExPoser syntax.

## What difference does this have to Expreviewer?
They are both identical in some degree. Implementation and engine compatibility is different though. Expreviewer is "7.6/8.1+" only while ExPoser Previewer is anywhere between 7.6/8.1 and below. Additionally, Expreviewer requires you to define characters manually while ExPoser Previewer does it automatically at runtime. My code isn't perfect obvs but its still gets the job done.

## Does this support the old Agent Gold Pose Tool?
No. ExPoser Previewer was designed to support DDLC and MPT/ExPoser syntax. This pose tool is obsolete and should be replaced with MPT + ExPoser.
